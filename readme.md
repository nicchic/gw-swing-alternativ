# Chaos
### Build Information
+ Build system: `Maven`
+ JDK Version: `17`

##### How to:
+ to make a clean build: `mvn clean package` (`mvn clean package -X`) to see verbose output.

### Project Structure
1. `src/main/java`
2. `src/main/resources`

This is a [Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) conforming structure.




### Interesting outlook
1.Using LLM inappropriately might degrade your intelligence. 
I assume that's like replacing the activation functions in the hidden layers of an MLP, with affine transformation.
One in 2025 can proudly claim AI work to be one's own work. 
Your LLM agent feels sad for that you are copying its work. 
Back in 2021, which is forty years ago, we have a word for it. Something starts in 'Pla' and ends in 'rism'. 
Would the human-IQ degradation be the backfire of AI?

2. An university student lacks study energy until few days before DDL$(days  \propto work\_load)$ . By then it's like supernova explosion.
This is generally true and is commonly accepted. Mostly this is because people feel the sense of crisis. The impending crisis of one's `Note`.
But how could one be less contributing, but also expecting a very high standard of `Note` to come? 
A psychologist indicated that in this scenario, the examined target is feeling something else from the sense of crisis.

3. Let $unicode\_\{BMP,SMP\}$(i.e. U+0000 to U+1FFFF) be the input. Let $mind$ be the model.
Say you are now pretending to be a (contextualized) categorizer, what is the probability/confidence of putting $emojis$ in Java code?
